# Simplebot by ramk13
# contibutions from mpeterv
# Open source bot with simple rules
# This was the approximate starting point for littlebot/fastbot
# Feel free to use this as the starting point for a bot
# Please give credit if you do though...

# Moves out of spawn, Flees if in danger,
# Chases dying enemies, Attacks adjacent enemies
# Attacks towards enemies two steps away
# Only moves to safe spots
# No two teammates should move into the same square
# Some teammates may move into stationary teammates

# Uses sets instead of lists for bot data structures
# This makes union/intersection a lot easier (credit to WALL-E for this idea)

# Ways to improve:
#   Instead of using pop() to attack in an arbitrary direction, pick intelligently
#   Instead of just moving to the closest enemy move to the closest weak enemy
#   In some cases it's worth moving into an enemy attack to be aggressive
#       (This really separates good bots from mediocre bots)
#   Try to trap enemy bots in spawn
#   Allow bots in trouble to move first and push other bots
#       (requires all moves to be decided on the first act call)
#   When fleeing look for the safest direction
